# Threat Model and Security Considerations

OAuth 2.0 is a widely used protocol for delegated authorization. However, like any security protocol, it is not without its risks. [RFC 6819](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6819) outlines several threat models and security considerations for OAuth 2.x servers.

## Threat Model

The OAuth 2.0 threat model includes several different actors and threats:

- Client:

    The client application that requests access to a protected resource.

- Resource Owner:

    The entity that owns the protected resource.

- Authorization Server:

    The server that issues access tokens to clients after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

- Resource Server:

    The server that hosts the protected resource and accepts access tokens as authorization for access.

- Attacker:

    An external party that attempts to gain unauthorized access to protected resources or to obtain access tokens by exploiting vulnerabilities in the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

Threats to the OAuth 2.0 protocol include:

- OAuth 2.0 Phishing Attacks:

    Attackers may attempt to trick users into revealing their OAuth 2.0 credentials through phishing attacks.

- OAuth 2.0 Token Theft:

    Attackers may attempt to steal OAuth 2.0 tokens in order to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

- OAuth 2.0 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:

    Attackers may attempt to intercept and manipulate communication between the client, authorization server, and resource server.

- Authorization Server Compromise:

    An attacker may attempt to compromise the authorization server in order to obtain access tokens or alter the authentication and authorization process.

- Token Expiration:

    Access tokens should have a short lifetime to prevent token theft.

- Token Replay:
    Access tokens may be replayed to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

- Token Leak:

    Access tokens may be leaked through a variety of methods, including insecure storage or transmission. Similar to token theft, this may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

## Security Considerations

To mitigate these threats, OAuth 2.0 servers should implement several security considerations, including:

- Use of HTTPS:

    All communications between the client, authorization server, and resource server should be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

- Access Token Validation:

    Resource servers should validate access tokens before granting access to protected resources.

- Token Storage:

    Access tokens should be stored securely, using encryption and appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

- Rate Limiting:

    Resource servers and authorization servers should implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from overwhelming the servers with requests.

- Client Authentication:

    Clients should be authenticated by the authorization server to ensure that only authorized clients are granted access tokens.

In addition to these considerations, OAuth 2.x servers should also follow best practices for secure coding, regular security audits, and user education to ensure that users understand the risks and are able to protect themselves against common attack vectors.

By carefully considering the threat model and implementing appropriate security measures, OAuth 2.x servers can provide secure and reliable access to protected resources.
