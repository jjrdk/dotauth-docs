# DotAuth

DotAuth provides an SDK to build an OAuth, OpenId and UMA2 server. In addition it provides a client library which can be used to retrieve tokens in your own mobile or desktop app. For development purposes there is also a dotnet tool which helps retrieve access tokens from the command line.

The [articles section](./articles/intro.md) holds descriptions and tutorials about using DotAuth to create a secure server setup.

In the [specifications section](./features/index.md) you can read all the acceptance test specifications written in Gherkin syntax.
